# STL Container Stack Implementation

This project is one of my university assignments. It involves creating an STL-like container stack implemented using a self-implemented two-way list in C++. The stack includes all essential methods required for its proper functioning.

## Features

- **Self-Implemented Two-Way List**: The underlying data structure for the stack is a custom two-way linked list.
- **Essential Stack Methods**: The stack supports all basic operations such as push, pop, top, and size.
- **STL-Like Interface**: Designed to mimic the interface and functionality of the standard STL stack container.

## Methods

- **push(element)**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **pop()**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **top()**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- **empty()**: Checks if the stack is empty.
